This userChrome file changes the tabs in Firefox to look similar to the second iteration of Chrome's tabs (trapezoid style). It is designed to match the Firefox's default dark mode theme.

The location for your userChrome file will be something like this:

* `C:\Users\<YOUR NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<PROFILE ID>.default\chrome\userChrome.css`

You may need to create the `chrome` folder and `userChrome.css` file yourself. If one already exists, you should rename it to `userChrome.css.BAK` as a backup.
